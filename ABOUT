ABOUT
Retebiome is a set of scripts used in the analysis of microbiome data. It currently has the ability to read in CSV data exported from a Perkin Elmer Labchip GXII. The scripts are principally intended to be used interactively through the Python REPL.

Similarity Calculation Example:
from bioanalyzer import *
testl6 = GetNumData(GetData(open("data1.csv").read().splitlines()))
testp6 = GetNumData(GetData(open("data2.csv").read().splitlines()))
GraphSimilarity(testp6[0], FlatRef(testp6[1], 80), testl6[0], FlatRef(testl6[1], 80))
